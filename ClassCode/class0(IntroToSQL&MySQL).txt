For those who find it hard to upload data, we also have a simple way to upload data to our MySQL.

select name, district, population from world.city 

where district = 'Herat';

select * from world.city 
-- customer is my table (room) and classicmodels is my schema(apartment).
where name = 'Karachi';


select * from world.city 
-- customer is my table (room) and classicmodels is my schema(apartment).
where name = 'Karachi';

The view contains rows and columns the same as the table; we can see but not edit without permission of admin

USE Poshem_cohort3; -- this ensures that yout code is executured in this DB

/* Create the tables */

CREATE TABLE Department (

  departmentID varchar(50) NOT NULL,

  DepartmentDescription varchar(4000) DEFAULT NULL,

  Departmentfloor numeric(5) NOT NULL,

  DepartmentName varchar(50) NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (Departmentid)

);

select * from world.city where CountryCode == 'AFG'

select * from world.city where Population < 23000;
